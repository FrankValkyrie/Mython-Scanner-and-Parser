# Mython-Scanner-and-Parser
Mython Scanner and Parser Built a scanner and parser for Mython language, inspired by Python. Wrote a scanner and parser to perform syntax analysis for a subset of Mython programs with 95% efficiency. Used jflex for lexical analysis &amp; wrote a recursive descent parser for syntax checking. Developed program using Java on a Linux environment.  Due to school policy, please contact me regarding permission to access the project, where I showcase the scanner and parser.
